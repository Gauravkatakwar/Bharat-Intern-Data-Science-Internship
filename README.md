## Task-1

# Stock Prediction Using LSTM :
### Dataset Summery :
This is a Dataset for the Stock prices for the stock of Google. It consists of 7 columns and a smaller subset of 4430 rows. Each column represents a specific attribute, and each row contains the corresponding values for that attribute.




## Task-2

# Titanic Classification :

### Dataset Summery :-
The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 remains a tragic event that has captured the world's imagination for over a century. Beyond its historical significance, the Titanic dataset has become a staple in the field of machine learning and data analysis. This dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their personal characteristics and whether they survived the disaster.In this analysis, we aim to build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.
The Titanic dataset is a collection of passenger records, each containing valuable information.The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, ticket class, number of siblings or spouses aboard,number of parents or children aboard, fare, cabin, and the port of embarkation. However, like many real-world datasets, the Titanic dataset has missing values that need to be addressed.Some passengers ages and cabin information are missing, which requires careful handling during preprocessing.
